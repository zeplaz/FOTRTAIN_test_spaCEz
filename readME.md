### FILES:
alot of test space learning some snips, and sytnax work,
however, building up a proper mixed make, and will be testing
c++ passing different stuff into FORTRAN and running the math, before returning.


###FUTURE PLANZ
clock situation is likey to
play a  part. usage of long doubles, arrays of doubles seening what can be done with valarrays into them.. ptr trunins etc to be process exlusivly in fortrain, and more preison outflows for chucks to be sent through, and then returned, tracking deltastimes and threading them out.. long term mixed goalz.
